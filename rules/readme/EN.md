# README writing guidelines

## 1. Motivation

Anyone (newcomer, not related to development or not from our team) should easily understand the essence of the project and run it without any help.

The `README.md` file is the backbone of any open source project.

- It gives a complete understanding of where the project is heading.
- It explains what this software is and why it is needed.
- It provides preconditions to help new project contributors get onboard faster.
- It helps to save time when getting to know the project.

Most importantly, the readme file says how

- Run this software for development purposes.
- Instructions for deploying software in production.

> _Make a rule for yourself:_ any project must start with a readme file. Make sure to add it to your project root so it can be seen on GitHub.
