# Project setup

## 1. Initializing the project

1.1. At the root of the repository, run the command:

```sh
yarn init
```

> _Note._ During the initialization process, do not forget to set the `private` flag to `true` if the repository should be private. This will prevent an accidental posting of code to `npm`.

1.2. At the beginning of `/package.json` manually add a link to the [homepage](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json/#toc-homepage):

```json
"homepage": "https://your-site.com"
```

1.3. Also at the end of `/package.json` add information about the [runtime](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json/#toc-engines). We currently use `node.js` 14 and `yarn` 1.22 everywhere.

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "14.*",
  "yarn": "1.22.*"
}
```

1.4. If for some reason the project is not intended to run from under Windows (for example, this is an iOS `react-native` app), add an [OS limitation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json/#toc-os) to`/package.json`:

```json
"os": ["!win32"]
```

1.5. At the root of the repository, create a [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file to ignore temporary files. Add the first rule to it - the `node_modules` directory.

## 2. Setting up `prettier` for a pre-commit hook

> _What's the point?_ We think [prettier](https://prettier.io/) is the best thing the industry has given developers (apart from Internet Explorer, of course ðŸ˜‰). Our principle is to automate what can be automated, and `prettier` does a great job of this, taking control over code formatting off the developers' shoulders.

2.1. Installing dependencies:

```sh
yarn add --dev prettier husky pretty-quick
```

> **Important.** We never add dependencies globally. _Why:_ different projects may require different versions of dependencies, in which case their management turns into chaos.

2.2. Initializing [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky):

```sh
npx husky-init
yarn husky set .husky/pre-commit "npx pretty-quick --staged"
```

2.3. Protect the hook from breaking by adding husky reinitialization to `package.json` every time the dependencies are updated:

```diff
"scripts": {
-  "prepare": "husky install",
+  "postinstall": "husky install",
  ...
```

2.4. In `/package.json` add a command to run `prettier` from `CI`:

```diff
"scripts": {
+  "prettier": "prettier --check .",
  "postinstall": "husky install",
  ...
```

> _Make a note._ Now we can also check the formatting locally with a simple command (`yarn run prettier`) or even automatically fix problems in the code (`yarn run prettier -w`).

2.5. Add the `prettier` config to the repository root - the `.prettierrc` file:

```json
{
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

2.6. Then put the file `.prettierignore` next to it - over time we will add directories and files that do not need to be formatted to it (for example, production bundles).

## 3. Setting up the editor

Put the file [settings.json](../../.vscode/settings.json) in the directory `/.vscode`.

## 4. Configuring the launch of `prettier` when opening a PR

4.1. **GitHub**: Put the file [validate_code.yml](./yml/validate_code.yml) in the directory `/.github/workflows`.

4.2. **GitLab**: Put the file [.gitlab-ci.yml](./yml/.gitlab-ci.yml) in the root of the repository.
